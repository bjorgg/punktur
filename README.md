# Module 6 - Growing complexity

This is our Module 6 group project for Web development at Reykjavík Technical School.

In this project we were supposed to create a complex web application. We worked with Agile methodologies, UI/UX, full design sprint, frameworks, data persistance, authentication, user accounts, user interface for CRUD operations, static page generation, continuous intergration, API connections, file uploading, sharing capabilities, AI intergration and public deployment.

## Punktur - Story sharing web application

[Punktur](https://punktur.vercel.app/) is a new medium for Iceland's reading enthusiasts and creative wordsmiths.

In our web application, everyone can come and read short stories and poems in Icelandic. You can categorize stories according to your interests and also listen to them with the speech synthesizer voice Dóra.

Users can log in and create a user account. As a user, you can post your own writing on the web and also give stories stars if you like them. This is the first version of the Punktur site and hopefully more features will come in the future!

One of the goals of the website is to maintain the Icelandic language and to help people publish their writings.

We at Punktur hope you like it and we accept all suggestions with thanks.
